# Zombie-Detector

### Background

This Zombie Detection model was created for DeepLearning.AI's [Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-computer-vision-with-tensorflow?) course, taught by [Laurence Moroney](https://laurencemoroney.com/).

The model is based on [RetinaNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002), cloned from [TensorFlow's Model Garden](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/).

### Set up

The notebook was developed for a Colab environment.

### Fine tuning

The model was fine-tuned on a training set consisting of 5 zombie images. Images are manually annotated in the Colab.
